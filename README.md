# HOW TO USE

Follow these steps to set up and run the Stable Diffusion installer on your Mac:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Open your terminal.
    - Run the following command to clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Islaster/installers.git
    ```

    - Change to the `installers` directory:

    ```bash
    cd installers
    ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
    - To make the script executable, run the following command:

    ```bash
    chmod +x mac_stable_diffusion_installer.sh
    ```

3. **Run the Script**:
    - Finally, run the script to install and set up Stable Diffusion by executing:

    ```bash
    ./mac_stable_diffusion_installer.sh
    ```

After running these commands, the script will handle the rest of the installation process for you. If Homebrew is not installed, the script will guide you through its installation. Once everything is set up, you can launch the Stable Diffusion web UI as instructed.
